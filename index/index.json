IT IS A COMBINATION OF ‘ITI IHA ĀSA’, LITERALLY MEANS ‘SO INDEED IT WAS’. Is it possible at all to measure knowledge? If possible, what are the parameters to measure knowledge? Express your views… 2 Once the devās came together and quantified knowledge. The four Vedās were placed on one side of a weighing scale, and Mahābhārata was placed on the other. The scales tipped toward Mahābhārata. 3 The four Vedas Mahābhārata 4 Vedās, devoid of a beginning or end, are considered as an infinite source of wisdom. Both the Itihāsas acknowledge the wisdom of Vedās as supreme. In fact, Mahābhārata reveals that Itihāsas and all purānās are intended to convey the supreme ideas of Vedās to untrained people. Mahābhārata is described as the pañcamaveda or the fifth Veda. The Chāndogya Upaniṣad describes all purānās and Itihāsas as pañcamaveda. Sometimes Nāṭyaśāstra and A̅yurveda are also categorized similarly. Then again, for all its vastness and completeness that is comparable to the vedās, the title best suits Mahābhārata. Why it was named Mahābhārata? ‘Mahatvāt bhāravatvāt cha mahābhāratam uchyate’ • the biggest literary work in the history of mankind • eighteen lakh words and one lakh ślokas • four times bigger than Rāmāyana • Iliad and Odyssey combined level to only one tenth of Mahābhārata • It is philosophical, spiritual and devotional • the subjects of discussion in Mahābhārata are the puruṣārthās • complex discussions on Dharma - Adharma, political strategies, warfare, history, geography, aesthetics etc. • lessons in statecraft, alongside lessons in forging alliances within personal, social and national spheres. • stutis like Viṣṇusahasranāma and Siva sahasranāma and that of devatās Siva, Viṣṇu, Durga, Agni Devā etc. are also seen in Mahābhārata. 6 Bhagavadgī tā- Bhā shyā s (discourses 0n Bhagavadgī tā) 7 Just like Śrī A̅diŚaṅkarācārya, several other A̅charyas like Śrī Abhinavagupta (Proponent of Kashmirashaiva philosophy), Śrī Mādhvāchārya (Dvaita philosophy), Śrī Rāmānujāchārya (viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy) among several others, have discussed the Bhagavadgītā through their Bhāshyās. Today, there are around 227 discourses on Bhagavadgītāin samskṛtam alone. 8 ŚrīA̅diŚaṅkarācārya considered Śrimad Bhagavadgītāof Mahābhārata, for laying the foundations of his darśana alongside the ten Upaniṣads and Brahmasu̅tra. Thus he said 'gītā-śastram samasta-vedārthasāra- saṅgraha-bhu̅tam' To inspire freedom movement, Lokmānya Tilak wrote his commentary on Bhagavadgītā, ‘Gītārahasyaṃ’ , with focus on Karmayoga. Many prominent people like M K Gandhi and Araviṇda Maharṣi were inspired by the Bhagavadgītā What is an Itihāsa? 9 History Myth Epic the analysis and interpretation of the past. It becomes a historical fiction when imagination and literary tools are added to it stories that revolve around the divine or people with divine powers, even though it discusses ideologies, morality and righteousness. a narrative that revolves around a particular incident discussing its origin, progress and consequences. (Aristotle) However, Itihāsas do not behold any of these characteristics. Then… “dharmārtha kāmamokṣānām pu̅rvavritham kathayuktham itihāsa prachakshyathe” Itihāsas explain the four puruṣārthas, dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa by narrating historic events in the form of stories. This purpose and nature of Itihāsas is clearly visible in Mahābhārata, from head to tail. Thus it is an Itihāsa 10 It would be a grievous error to consider the literary genre of a particular language as universal and equate unique literary genres of other languages in​to it. This would make for a huge categorical blunder. 11 Swami Vivekananda describes Itihāsas as the encyclopedia of knowledge and A̅ryasamskriti.

Preamble to the Grand Itihāsa WHAT DOES THE WORD ITIHĀSA MEAN? IT IS A COMBINATION OF ‘ITI IHA ĀSA’, LITERALLY MEANS ‘SO INDEED IT WAS’. Is it possible at all to measure knowledge? If possible, what are the parameters to measure knowledge? Express your views… 2 Once the devās came together and quantified knowledge. The four Vedās were placed on one side of a weighing scale, and Mahābhārata was placed on the other. The scales tipped toward Mahābhārata. 3 The four Vedas Mahābhārata 4 Vedās, devoid of a beginning or end, are considered as an infinite source of wisdom. Both the Itihāsas acknowledge the wisdom of Vedās as supreme. In fact, Mahābhārata reveals that Itihāsas and all purānās are intended to convey the supreme ideas of Vedās to untrained people. Mahābhārata is described as the pañcamaveda or the fifth Veda. The Chāndogya Upaniṣad describes all purānās and Itihāsas as pañcamaveda. Sometimes Nāṭyaśāstra and A̅yurveda are also categorized similarly. Then again, for all its vastness and completeness that is comparable to the vedās, the title best suits Mahābhārata. Why it was named Mahābhārata? ‘Mahatvāt bhāravatvāt cha mahābhāratam uchyate’ • the biggest literary work in the history of mankind • eighteen lakh words and one lakh ślokas • four times bigger than Rāmāyana • Iliad and Odyssey combined level to only one tenth of Mahābhārata • It is philosophical, spiritual and devotional • the subjects of discussion in Mahābhārata are the puruṣārthās • complex discussions on Dharma - Adharma, political strategies, warfare, history, geography, aesthetics etc. • lessons in statecraft, alongside lessons in forging alliances within personal, social and national spheres. • stutis like Viṣṇusahasranāma and Siva sahasranāma and that of devatās Siva, Viṣṇu, Durga, Agni Devā etc. are also seen in Mahābhārata. 6 Bhagavadgī tā- Bhā shyā s (discourses 0n Bhagavadgī tā) 7 Just like Śrī A̅diŚaṅkarācārya, several other A̅charyas like Śrī Abhinavagupta (Proponent of Kashmirashaiva philosophy), Śrī Mādhvāchārya (Dvaita philosophy), Śrī Rāmānujāchārya (viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy) among several others, have discussed the Bhagavadgītā through their Bhāshyās. Today, there are around 227 discourses on Bhagavadgītāin samskṛtam alone. 8 ŚrīA̅diŚaṅkarācārya considered Śrimad Bhagavadgītāof Mahābhārata, for laying the foundations of his darśana alongside the ten Upaniṣads and Brahmasu̅tra. Thus he said 'gītā-śastram samasta-vedārthasāra- saṅgraha-bhu̅tam' To inspire freedom movement, Lokmānya Tilak wrote his commentary on Bhagavadgītā, ‘Gītārahasyaṃ’ , with focus on Karmayoga. Many prominent people like M K Gandhi and Araviṇda Maharṣi were inspired by the Bhagavadgītā What is an Itihāsa? 9 History Myth Epic the analysis and interpretation of the past. It becomes a historical fiction when imagination and literary tools are added to it stories that revolve around the divine or people with divine powers, even though it discusses ideologies, morality and righteousness. a narrative that revolves around a particular incident discussing its origin, progress and consequences. (Aristotle) However, Itihāsas do not behold any of these characteristics. Then… “dharmārtha kāmamokṣānām pu̅rvavritham kathayuktham itihāsa prachakshyathe” Itihāsas explain the four puruṣārthas, dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa by narrating historic events in the form of stories. This purpose and nature of Itihāsas is clearly visible in Mahābhārata, from head to tail. Thus it is an Itihāsa 10 It would be a grievous error to consider the literary genre of a particular language as universal and equate unique literary genres of other languages in​to it. This would make for a huge categorical blunder. 11 Swami Vivekananda describes Itihāsas as the encyclopedia of knowledge and A̅ryasamskriti.

(the best among the Bharatas), whatever is found in Mahābhārata about dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa, may be found anywhere else. But, what is not in this Itihāsa, cannot be found elsewhere. puruṣārthās are qualities that should be imbibed by an individual and determines the progress of his life. 12  Kāma, means desire.  Artha, represents the effort to fulfil Kāma.  Care must be taken to not disrupt the existing balance towards nature and fellow beings, and that concern is Dharma.  Mokṣa is the ultimate freedom from the bondage of Artha and Kāma puruṣārthās 13 Can Kāma be limitless? Which type of effort (Artha) should be taken by us to fulfil Kāma? Bharat celebrates the idea that one must acquire Artha in accordance with Dharma and experience Kāma also in accordance with Dharma. Living this way, all beings walk toward their final goal, which is Mokṣa. Why Itihāsas? “Itihāsa pura̅n̅a̅bhya̅m̅ve̅dam̅samupabrim̅haye̅t bhibhe̅dyalpa shruta̅dve̅do̅ma̅yayam̅pratare̅diti” Mahābhārata itself proclaims that, since Veda̅s themselves are afraid of people with half knowledge (AlpaSruta), because they may interpret Veda̅s wrongly, the essence of Veda̅s have to be explained with the help of Itihāsas and pura̅na̅s Satguru Śrī Mātā Amritānandamayī Devī tells us that the Mahābhārata war is also a representation of our internal struggles. The Author Maharṣi Veda Vyāsa • Born as Kṛṣṇadwaipāyana to Satyavati and Parāsara Muni. He is known by the name Dwaipāyana as he was born on an island. • Divided the vedās to four and composed the fifth veda, Mahābhārata. • He is considered as the author of the eighteen purānas, the commentary on Patanjali Yoga Sutras and one of the fundamental texts of Vedanta philosophy - Brahmasutra. • Srimad Bhāgavata Purāna depicts Maharṣi Veda Vyāsa as one of the twenty-two main avatars of Bhagavān Vishnu. • In Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Lord Kṛṣṇa reveals that “Among Maharṣis, I am Vyāsa”. • appearing at the beginning and the ending of the Itihāsa and capable of controlling the flow and direction of the story. Birth of the Itihāsa • Maharṣi Vyāsa approached Brahma for a person to write Mahābhārata. • Bhagavān Mahāganapati was given the task of writing Mahābhārata from Maharṣi Vyāsa. • They had a pact that Vyāsa should dictate the entire Itihāsa without any pause or interruption, Ganapati should write only after fully understanding the meaning of the narrated verses. • Thus Mahābhārata was composed by Maharṣi Vyāsa, an incarnation of Bhagavān Vishnu and written by the omniscient son of Bhagavān Shiva, Ganesha on Brahma’s advice. • after completion of Mahābhārata, Vyāsa narrated it to his son Shuka and his other śiṣyas • Mahābhārata presents itself as a narration by Vaishamapāyana, as commanded by Maharṣi Vyāsa, in the sarpasatra yajna of King Janamejaya. • Later Lomaharshana’s son, Ugrasravas, who narrated Mahābhārata to the rishis in Shaunaka’s satra at Naimiṣāranyam Inside Mahābhārata In the A̅diparva, Maharṣi Vyāsa uses a beautiful metaphor to sketch and compare the characters Yudhishthira and Duryodhana. Duryodhana is a huge tree, angry by nature. Karna is its trunk, Śakuni is the branches. Its flowers and fruits represent Dushasana. the naive Dhritarāshtra forms the roots of that tree of anger. Yudhishthira is a great tree of Dharma. Arjuna is the trunk, Bhima is the branches. The flowers and fruits are Nakula-Sahadeva. Its roots, Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself, the Brahmajnas and the Vedās.
